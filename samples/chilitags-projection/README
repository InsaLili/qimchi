Demonstration of QMLChilitags in a camera+projection setting
============================================================

This demo shows how to display graphical elements linked to tags placed on the
display surface.

The demo is contained in the main.qml file, which serves as documentation with
its comments.

The other files simply come from the "New sub-project/Qt Quick application"
wizard from Qt Creator, except for this line add into main.cpp:
```
    engine.addImportPath("../imports");
```
