Demonstration of Augmented Reality with QMLChilitags
====================================================

This demo shows how to add graphical elements linked to tags appearing on a
camera image.

The demo is contained in the main.qml file, which serves as documentation with
its comments.

The other files simply come from the "New sub-project/Qt Quick application"
wizard from Qt Creator, except for this line add into main.cpp:
```
    engine.addImportPath("../imports");
```
